This is the README file for the CSE 6730 Project.

To build the simulator, simply run the make command.
To run the simulator, run ./sim
This should run a simulation of a default door configuration.

NOTE: The simulator has been tested under both Mac OS X

build properly, please send an email to karl@gatech.edu.
