Evacuation-problem
==================

class proj, using Cellualar Automata

This is a class project of CSE6730 at GaTech, we used cellular automata to simulate the situation that 1000 people evacuating 
from a certain area. By doing the simulation, we aim to find the best arrangement of emergency exits of a building. This is 
a very practical proj, and all the data were based on a building ar Tech-Square close to the campus.
